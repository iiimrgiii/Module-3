# Election Audit Summary
This script could be used by the enrtire state or all states to be used to simplify and easily read the votes won. You could modify it to get as presise as you wanted to get, you would just need to get more data on the sheet. One aspect you could add into this report now is to see who won each county and break it down that way. Another way you could use this data is to track the and keep a history of the voting trends of the IDs. But as long as any other region were to use a similar format of the CSV file, this could be used easily with no real modification besides changing the file path.
